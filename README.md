# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript and Python
The repo represents a variety data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch in both JavaScript and Python in a clear, concise way. 

The purpose of the repo was to strengthen my skill at both programming languages along with reinforcing fundamental concepts of computer science. 

In progress still..
